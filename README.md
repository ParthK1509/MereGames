I have added complete files of only one of my game, ballrun2, you can find the executable file for it in BallRun2 Folder
All of my other projects executables have been uploaded to the ~google drive~ -> https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1twkJ-yDyd72hJQ5_TXspuCYyGWd9mQbU

# Guide:
Except for AR app, you have to download Must Download folder, with any game you want to download to make it run, for AR app, you can just download it to your mobile and run.

Enjoy!
